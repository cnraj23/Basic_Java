1. create account on db4free.net
2. create account on 000webhost.com
3. create database in db4free and connect it to java file as showed.
4. Main.java is for entering the data.
5. fetching.java is to receive data from database.
6. Once database is working perfectly in java your first part is sucessful.
7. Now to use that Database and convert it into JSON use the code from json.php file.
8. add the same connection details into json.php file from main.java
9. Upload that json.php file on your account of 000webhost.com File Manager
